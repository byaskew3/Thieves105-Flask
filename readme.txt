1. Adjust home page to display different users in our database
-- on main routes, query all users
-- update for loop on index.html
-- polish home page

2. Follow Model (Join Table)
-- Reference back to ERD
-- Create Followers Model/Table
-- Create follow/unfollow methods
-- update database (flask db migrate, flask db upgrade)
-- ig.routes create follow dynamic route & functionality
-- verify follow functionality works in database

(Unfollow functionality)
-- create a set in main routes to check which users are being followed by current_user
-- ig.routes create unfollow dynamic route & functionality
(Will look very similar to follow route)

3. flask-moment
-- Displays timestamps to the frontend
